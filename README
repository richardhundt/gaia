== Gaia Lua Compiler Tools

Gaia aims to provide a parser and bytecode generator for the Lua VM to
aid in targetting the Lua VM as a runtime for other dynamic languages. At
this stage only Lua 5.1 is supported.

Documentation needs to be written, but right now I need to get the code
into shape.

In the meantime, this ships with a simple language called Kudu which
can be used as a reference.
